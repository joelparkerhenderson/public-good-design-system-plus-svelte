# Button

A button is a fundamental UI/UX component that allows users to trigger an action
or event within an interface, such as submitting a form, navigating to another
page, or opening a menu. Typically, buttons are rectangular or rounded with text
or icons that describe their function (e.g., "Submit," "Cancel," or "Next").
They are often styled to be visually distinct, using colors, shadows, and hover
effects to signal interactivity. Buttons play a crucial role in user navigation
and interaction, making them essential for guiding users through tasks,
providing clear feedback on actions, and enhancing the overall user experience
by offering intuitive, actionable controls.

# ROYGB Status Input

A ROYGB (Red/Orange/Yellow/Green/Blue) status input is a UI/UX component that
allows users to select a five-level color-coded status value from a dropdown.
ROYGB extends the traditional RAG (Red/Amber/Green) model by adding orange
and blue levels for more granular status reporting. Red indicates a critical
problem, orange signals a hazard or significant risk, yellow means caution or
minor issues, green indicates normal on-track status, and blue represents a
paused or informational state. The component renders as a select element with
appropriate accessibility attributes, providing native keyboard navigation and
screen reader support. This headless component provides the semantic structure
while allowing consumers to apply their own visual styling.

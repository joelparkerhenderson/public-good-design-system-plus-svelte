# Toggle

A toggle is a UI/UX component that provides a binary on/off control using a
button with role="switch". It communicates its state through aria-checked and
supports both click and keyboard (Space key) interaction. Toggles are commonly
used for settings like dark mode, notifications, or feature flags where a user
needs to switch between two states. The pressed state is bindable for two-way
data flow.

# Spinner

A spinner is a UI/UX component used to indicate that a process or action is
currently in progress, typically involving loading, submitting, or fetching
data. It often appears as a rotating icon or animated graphic, signaling to
users that they need to wait momentarily. Spinners help manage user expectations
and improve perceived performance by providing visual feedback during delays.
While they don’t convey exact timing, they reassure users that the system is
working. A well-designed spinner is subtle, visually consistent with the
interface, and ideally accompanied by a message or progress indicator if the
wait is expected to be long.

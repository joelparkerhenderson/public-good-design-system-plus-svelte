# Panel

A panel is a UI/UX component that serves as a container for grouping related
content, controls, or settings within an interface. Panels are commonly used in
dashboards, sidebars, modals, or collapsible sections to organize information in
a structured and accessible way. They help break down complex interfaces into
manageable sections, improving clarity and user focus. Panels often include
headers, content areas, and optional actions like buttons or icons, and can be
static or interactive—such as draggable or expandable. By compartmentalizing
content, panels enhance usability and allow users to navigate and interact with
information more efficiently.

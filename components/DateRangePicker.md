# Date range picker

A date range picker is a UI/UX component that combines paired date inputs with
picker semantics, enabling users to select a start date and end date for
defining a time span. Commonly used in hotel booking systems, travel search
forms, event scheduling interfaces, and analytics dashboards, the date range
picker provides a structured way to capture date spans with clear labels for
each boundary. It enhances usability by grouping related inputs within a
fieldset, ensuring users understand the relationship between the start and end
dates. Effective date range picker design includes accessible labels for each
input, supports bindable values for reactive state management, and works with
native date inputs for broad browser compatibility and built-in validation.

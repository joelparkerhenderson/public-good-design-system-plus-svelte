# Timeline

A timeline is a UI/UX component used to visually organize and display events,
steps, or data points in chronological order, helping users understand
progression over time. Commonly used in project tracking, activity feeds,
historical overviews, or user journeys, timelines can be vertical, horizontal,
or interactive, often incorporating icons, dates, and brief descriptions for
clarity. This component aids comprehension by making complex sequences more
intuitive and scannable. Effective timeline design emphasizes readability,
logical flow, and visual hierarchy, allowing users to quickly grasp the order,
timing, and significance of events or stages.

This component renders as a semantic ordered list (<ol>) with an accessible
label, conveying the chronological nature of the content to both sighted users
and screen reader users. The consumer provides individual timeline entries as
<li> children through the children snippet.

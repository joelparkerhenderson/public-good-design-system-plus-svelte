# Rating group

A rating group is a UI/UX component that allows users to select a rating value
from a set of discrete options, typically represented as stars, hearts, thumbs,
or other symbols. Commonly used in product reviews, feedback forms, survey
questionnaires, and content evaluation interfaces, the rating group provides an
intuitive way for users to express a qualitative judgment on a numeric scale.
Each option in the group functions as a radio button, allowing exactly one value
to be selected at a time. Effective rating group design uses a radiogroup role
within a fieldset to semantically group the options, provides an accessible
label describing what is being rated, and ensures that each rating option is
keyboard navigable and clearly announced to screen reader users.

# File manager

A file manager is a UI/UX component that provides an interface for browsing,
organizing, and managing files and directories. Commonly used in content
management systems, cloud storage applications, document editors, and admin
dashboards, the file manager enables users to navigate folder hierarchies,
view file listings, and perform operations such as uploading, downloading,
renaming, and deleting files. It brings familiar desktop file management
patterns to web applications, helping users work with their content
efficiently. Effective file manager design uses a semantic region with an
accessible label to define its boundary, supports keyboard navigation for
file selection and folder traversal, and communicates the current context
to assistive technologies so that all users can manage files independently.

# Task list

A task list is a UI/UX component that organizes and displays a series of tasks,
actions, or to-dos for users to complete. It is typically presented as a
checklist, where each task can be marked as completed or remain pending. Task
lists are commonly used in project management tools, to-do apps, or onboarding
processes to guide users through a sequence of actions. They help improve
productivity by breaking down complex workflows into manageable steps, offering
clear progress tracking. Effective task list design includes features like task
prioritization, due dates, and visual indicators (such as checkboxes or progress
bars) to enhance user clarity and motivation.

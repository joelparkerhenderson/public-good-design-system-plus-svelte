# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a UI/UX navigation component that displays a trail of links
showing the user's current location within a website or app's hierarchy,
typically appearing near the top of a page. Each link represents a parent page,
allowing users to easily backtrack or understand the structure of the site.
Breadcrumbs enhance usability by improving orientation, reducing the number of
actions needed to navigate, and helping users avoid getting lost—especially in
websites with deep or complex navigation paths, like e-commerce or content-heavy
platforms.

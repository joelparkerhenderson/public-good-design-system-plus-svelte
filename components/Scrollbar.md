# Scrollbar

A scrollbar is a UI/UX component that allows users to navigate vertically or
horizontally through content that extends beyond the visible area of a container
or screen. It typically appears as a bar along the side or bottom of a
scrollable region, with a draggable thumb (or handle) that represents the user's
current view relative to the total content. A scrollbar provides a user with
both control and context, showing how much content is available and where they
are within it. A well-designed scrollbar is responsive, unobtrusive, and
visually aligned with the overall interface, ensuring smooth navigation without
distracting from the main content.

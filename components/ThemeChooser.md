# Theme chooser

A theme chooser is a UI/UX component that allows users to switch between
different visual styles or color schemes of an interface, most commonly between
light and dark themes. This component enhances personalization and accessibility
by letting users select a theme that suits their preferences, environment, or
visual comfort—such as using dark mode in low-light settings to reduce eye
strain. Typically found in settings menus or as a toggle icon (like a sun/moon),
the theme chooser contributes to a more user-centric experience by adapting the
interface to different contexts while maintaining consistent functionality.

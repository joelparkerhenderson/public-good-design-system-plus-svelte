# Header

A header is a fundamental UI/UX component typically positioned at the top of a
web page or app screen, serving as a consistent area for branding, navigation,
and key actions. It often contains elements like a logo, navigation links,
search bars, user profiles, or call-to-action buttons. The header plays a
crucial role in guiding users, providing context, and enabling quick access to
essential features across the site or application. A well-designed header
enhances usability, reinforces brand identity, and supports intuitive navigation
throughout the user experience.

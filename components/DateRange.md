# Date range

A date range is a UI/UX component that provides paired start and end date
inputs, allowing users to specify a span of time. Commonly used in booking
forms, search filters, reporting interfaces, and scheduling tools, the date
range component groups two date inputs together with a shared label to
communicate that they represent a related pair. It simplifies the process of
entering date spans by clearly associating start and end fields, reducing user
confusion and input errors. Effective date range design uses a fieldset to
semantically group the inputs, provides distinct accessible labels for each
date field, and supports two-way binding so that consuming applications can
easily read and react to changes in the selected date span.

# Back link

A back link in UI/UX is a navigational component that allows users to return
to a previous page or step within an app or website, often represented as a
left-pointing arrow accompanied by text like “Back” or the name of the previous
page. It enhances usability by providing a clear, intuitive way to reverse
navigation without relying solely on the browser’s back button. Back links are
especially important in mobile and multi-step interfaces, helping users maintain
their sense of orientation and reducing frustration by making navigation feel
more seamless and controlled.

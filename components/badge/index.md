# Badge

A badge is a small UI/UX component typically used to display dynamic status
information, counts, or indicators in a compact, visually prominent format.
Commonly seen as a colored circle or label attached to icons, buttons, or list
items, badges are often used to show unread messages, notification counts, or
activity statuses. They help draw attention to specific elements without
interrupting the user experience. Effective badge design ensures high visibility
through contrast and placement, while keeping content minimal—usually numbers,
short text, or symbols—to quickly convey information at a glance.

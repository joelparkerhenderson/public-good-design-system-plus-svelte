# Postal code view

A postal code view is a UI/UX component that displays a postal or ZIP code as
read-only text within a span element. It is used to present postal code
information in address displays, confirmation pages, or summary views where the
value is not editable. The component accepts a text prop for the postal code
string and supports additional HTML attributes through rest props for flexible
integration into any layout.

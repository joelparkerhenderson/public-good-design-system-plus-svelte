# File dialog

A file dialog is a UI/UX component that allows users to browse, select, and
upload files from their device to a website or application. Typically activated
by a button labeled “Choose File” or “Upload,” it opens a system dialog where
users can navigate folders and select one or more files. This component is
essential in forms, messaging apps, and content management systems where
user-generated content or document submission is required. A well-designed file
dialog enhances usability by clearly indicating accepted file types, providing
feedback after selection (like showing the file name), and ensuring
accessibility across devices and platforms.

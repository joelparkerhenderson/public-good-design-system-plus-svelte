# Kanban board

A Kanban board is a UI/UX component that organizes work items into columns
representing different stages of a workflow, such as "To Do," "In Progress,"
and "Done." Commonly used in project management tools, agile development
platforms, and task tracking applications, the Kanban board provides a visual
overview of work status and flow, helping teams identify bottlenecks and
prioritize tasks. Items can typically be moved between columns as they progress
through the workflow, often via drag-and-drop interaction. Effective Kanban
board design uses a semantic region with an accessible label to define the
board boundary, supports keyboard interaction for moving items between columns,
and ensures that status changes and board structure are communicated clearly to
assistive technologies.

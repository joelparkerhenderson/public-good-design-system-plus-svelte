# Switch input

A switch input is a UI/UX component that provides a binary toggle control,
similar to a physical on/off switch. It uses role="switch" with aria-checked to
communicate the current state to assistive technologies. The component supports
both click and keyboard (Space key) activation for accessibility compliance. It
is commonly used for settings, preferences, and feature toggles where users need
to enable or disable a single option without submitting a form.

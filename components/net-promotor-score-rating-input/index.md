# Net Promoter Score Rating Input

A Net Promoter Score (NPS) rating input is a UI/UX component that allows users
to select a score from 0 to 10, representing their likelihood to recommend a
product, service, or organization. It is a widely used customer loyalty metric
developed by Fred Reichheld and Bain & Company. The component renders as a
fieldset with a radiogroup role containing 11 radio buttons, one for each score
value. Scores are typically categorized as Detractors (0-6), Passives (7-8),
and Promoters (9-10). This headless component provides the semantic structure
and accessibility features while allowing consumers to apply their own visual
styling.

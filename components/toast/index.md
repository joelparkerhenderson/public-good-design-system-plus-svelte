# Toast

A toast is a UI/UX component that provides a brief, transient notification
message to the user. It uses role="status" with aria-live="polite" by default,
or role="alert" with aria-live="assertive" for urgent messages. Toasts are
typically displayed temporarily to confirm actions, report errors, or provide
status updates without requiring user interaction. They are similar to
notifications but are generally more ephemeral and less intrusive.

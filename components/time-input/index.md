# Time input

A time input is a UI/UX component that provides a field for entering time values
using the native HTML `<input type="time">` element. It renders a time picker
control appropriate to the user's browser and operating system. The component
supports bindable value in HH:MM format, aria-label for accessibility, and
standard form attributes like required and disabled.

# RAG Status Input

A RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status input is a UI/UX component that allows users to
select a traffic-light status value from a dropdown. RAG status is one of the
most widely used status indicators in project management, dashboards, and
reporting tools. Red indicates a critical problem that needs immediate
attention, amber signals caution or minor issues, and green means everything is
on track. The component renders as a select element with appropriate
accessibility attributes, providing native keyboard navigation and screen
reader support. This headless component provides the semantic structure while
allowing consumers to apply their own visual styling.

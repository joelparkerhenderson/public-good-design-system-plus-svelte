# Slide-out drawer

A slide-out drawer is a UI/UX component that slides in from the side of the
screen—usually from the left or right—to reveal additional content or navigation
options without leaving the current page. Often triggered by a button or swipe
gesture, it’s commonly used for menus, filters, settings, or secondary content
in mobile and web applications. This component allows for efficient use of
screen space by keeping less frequently used options hidden until needed,
enhancing focus and minimizing clutter in the main interface while maintaining
easy access to extended functionality.

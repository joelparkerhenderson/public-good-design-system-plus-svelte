# United Kingdom National Health Service Number Input

A United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) number input is a specialized
form field for entering a 10-digit NHS patient identifier. The NHS number is
assigned to every patient registered with the National Health Service in
England, Wales, and the Isle of Man, and is used to uniquely identify
individuals across the health system.

The standard display format is "XXX XXX XXXX" (three groups of digits separated
by spaces). This input component enforces that pattern, uses a numeric keyboard
hint for mobile devices, and disables autocomplete to protect sensitive health
information. The component supports required and disabled states, and provides
accessible labeling for screen readers.

# Range input

A range input is a UI/UX component that provides a slider control for selecting
a numeric value within a defined range. It uses the native HTML range input
element, which renders as a draggable track and handle. The component supports
configurable minimum, maximum, and step values, and provides a bindable value
prop for two-way data binding. An aria-label ensures the control is accessible to
screen readers and assistive technologies.

# Contents List Item

A contents list item is a UI/UX component representing a single entry within a
table of contents or navigation list. It renders as a semantic list item (<li>)
that typically contains a link to a section of a page or document.

Contents list items are used as children of ordered or unordered lists within a
table of contents component. They support nesting for hierarchical document
structures where sections contain subsections. The consumer provides the content
(usually an anchor link with descriptive text) through the children snippet, and
can add aria-current attributes to indicate the currently active section.

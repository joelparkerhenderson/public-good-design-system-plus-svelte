# Dial

A dial is a circular UI/UX component that allows users to adjust or view a value
by rotating a knob or indicator along a fixed range, similar to physical dials
on devices like thermostats or volume controls. It provides an intuitive and
tactile interaction, often used in applications involving precision settings,
such as audio levels, timers, or control panels. Dials can also serve as visual
indicators of current values, making them useful for monitoring data in a
compact, stylish format. Effective dial design combines smooth interaction,
clear labeling, and visual feedback to ensure accuracy and ease of use.

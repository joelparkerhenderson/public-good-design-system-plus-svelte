# Care Card

A care card is a healthcare-oriented UI component for displaying medical
guidance with varying levels of urgency. Inspired by the NHS England design
system, care cards communicate health advice in three tiers: non-urgent
(speak to a GP), urgent (visit A&E or call 111), and immediate (call 999).

Each care card has a heading that describes the action and a body containing
the relevant advice or conditions. The `data-type` attribute allows consumers
to apply urgency-appropriate styling (e.g., blue for non-urgent, red for
immediate).

# Separator

A separator is a UI/UX component that provides a visual and semantic divider
between sections of content. It uses the native HTML `<hr>` element with
role="separator" for proper accessibility semantics. An optional label prop can
be used to provide additional context about the separation for screen readers.
Separators help organize content into logical groups and improve visual hierarchy
without adding unnecessary complexity.

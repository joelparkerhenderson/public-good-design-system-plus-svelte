# Reset input

A reset input is a UI/UX component that provides a form reset button using the
native HTML `<input type="reset">` element. When clicked within a form, it
resets all form fields to their initial values. The component supports custom
button text through the value prop and can be disabled when form resetting should
be prevented. It is useful in forms where users may want to clear all entered
data and start over.

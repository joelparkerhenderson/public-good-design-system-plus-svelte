# Error message

An error message is a UI/UX component that informs users when something has gone
wrong, such as incorrect input, failed actions, or system issues. It plays a
critical role in guiding users by clearly communicating what went wrong, why it
happened, and how to fix it—ideally using plain, friendly language and visual
cues like color (often red) or icons. Effective error messages reduce user
frustration, support task completion, and enhance overall trust in the
interface. Whether shown inline, as pop-ups, or banners, well-designed error
messages contribute to a smoother, more supportive user experience.

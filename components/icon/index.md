# Icon

An icon is a compact and visually intuitive UI/UX component that represents
actions, objects, or concepts using simplified graphical symbols. Icons enhance
usability by providing quick visual cues that help users navigate interfaces,
identify functions, or understand information without relying on text alone.
Commonly used in buttons, menus, and toolbars, icons can improve interface
clarity and save space, especially in mobile or minimalist designs. Effective
icon design prioritizes clarity, consistency, and recognizability, often
accompanied by labels or tooltips to ensure accessibility and prevent ambiguity,
especially for new or less familiar symbols.

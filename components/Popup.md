# Popup

A popup is a UI/UX component that temporarily appears over the main content to
convey information, prompt user actions, or display additional options without
navigating away from the current screen. Popups can take various forms—such as
tooltips, modals, or contextual menus—and are often triggered by user
interactions like clicks, hovers, or page events. They are useful for drawing
attention to specific elements, providing quick feedback, or offering
supplementary details. Effective popup design focuses on timing, relevance, and
minimal disruption, ensuring users receive the necessary information or controls
without feeling overwhelmed or interrupted.

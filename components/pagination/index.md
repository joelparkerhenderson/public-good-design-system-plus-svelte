# Pagination

Pagination is a UI/UX component that divides content into separate pages,
allowing users to navigate through large sets of data or information one section
at a time. Commonly used in search results, product listings, and long article
feeds, pagination improves performance and readability by loading only a portion
of the content at once. It typically appears as a series of numbered links,
along with “Previous” and “Next” buttons, enabling users to easily move forward
or backward through content. This component helps manage content overload,
enhances navigation, and gives users a clear sense of progress and location
within a dataset or multi-page layout.

# Image

An image is a fundamental UI/UX component used to display visual content, such
as photographs, illustrations, or icons, within an interface. Images enhance
user experience by providing visual context, supporting storytelling, or
reinforcing brand identity. They are commonly used in product galleries, blogs,
advertisements, and content-heavy websites. Effective image design ensures
optimal sizing, clarity, and responsiveness across different devices, as well as
proper loading techniques to avoid performance issues. When integrated well,
images can improve user engagement, guide attention, and contribute to a more
visually appealing and intuitive interface.

# Sonner

A sonner is a UI/UX component that serves as a toast notification region,
providing a designated area where brief, non-intrusive messages appear to inform
users of events, confirmations, or status updates. Commonly used for success
confirmations, error alerts, progress updates, and system messages, the sonner
displays transient notifications that appear and automatically dismiss after a
short duration without requiring user interaction. Unlike modal dialogs that
interrupt workflow, toast notifications communicate feedback passively while
allowing users to continue their current task. Effective sonner design uses a
live region with polite announcement priority so that screen reader users are
informed of new notifications without being interrupted, and provides an
accessible label to identify the notification area within the page structure.

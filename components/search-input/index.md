# Search input

A search input is a UI/UX component that provides a text field specifically for
search queries. It uses the native HTML `<input type="search">` element, which
provides semantic meaning and may trigger search-specific browser behaviors such
as a clear button or search icon. The component includes aria-label for
accessibility and supports bindable value for two-way data binding, making it
easy to integrate with search functionality in any application.

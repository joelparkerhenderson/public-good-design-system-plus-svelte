# Postal code input

A postal code input is a UI/UX component that provides a text field specifically
designed for entering postal or ZIP codes. It includes autocomplete support for
postal codes, enabling browsers to auto-fill the value from stored address data.
The input uses aria-label for accessibility and supports standard form attributes
like required and disabled. This component helps streamline address forms by
providing semantic meaning and browser integration for postal code entry.

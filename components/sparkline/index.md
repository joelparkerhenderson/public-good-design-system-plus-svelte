# Sparkline

A sparkline is a compact, minimalist UI/UX component used to represent trends or
variations in data within a small, simple graph, typically embedded within text
or tables. Unlike full-scale charts, sparklines display data as tiny, unadorned
line, bar, or win/loss charts, offering a quick, at-a-glance view of patterns,
such as fluctuations in sales, stock prices, or performance over time. They are
particularly useful in dashboards or reports where space is limited but quick
data insights are needed. Sparklines are designed to convey trends without
detailed context or axes, focusing purely on the visual representation of data
movement or distribution.

# Net Promoter Score Rating View

A Net Promoter Score (NPS) rating view is a UI/UX component that displays an
NPS score value as read-only text. It is used to present previously captured
NPS data in dashboards, reports, or detail views. The component renders as a
span element with an accessible label, making the score readable by screen
readers and other assistive technologies. This headless component provides the
semantic structure and accessibility features while allowing consumers to apply
their own visual styling, such as color-coding by score range (Detractors 0-6,
Passives 7-8, Promoters 9-10).

# Collapsible

A collapsible (disclosure) component allows users to expand or collapse a
section of content. Built on the native HTML `<details>` and `<summary>`
elements, it provides built-in keyboard support and screen reader announcements
without any JavaScript.

The summary text is always visible and acts as the toggle trigger. The
content below is hidden when collapsed and revealed when expanded.
# Collapsible

- Native `<details>`/`<summary>` for built-in a11y
- `$bindable()` open prop for two-way binding
- No ARIA needed — native elements handle it

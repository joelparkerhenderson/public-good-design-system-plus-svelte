# Timer

A timer is a UI/UX component that displays a countdown or elapsed time value
in a live-updating format. It renders as a semantic HTML `<time>` element with
`role="timer"` and `aria-live="polite"` to ensure screen readers announce
updates without interrupting the user. The component is commonly used for
session timeouts, countdowns, stopwatches, cooking timers, exam time limits,
and any scenario where users need to track the passage of time. This headless
component provides the semantic structure and accessibility features while the
consumer manages the actual timer logic and provides formatted display content
through the children snippet.

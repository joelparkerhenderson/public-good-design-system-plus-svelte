# URL input

A URL input is a UI/UX component that provides a text field specifically for
entering web addresses. It uses the native HTML `<input type="url">` element,
which provides built-in URL validation and may trigger URL-specific keyboard
layouts on mobile devices. The component includes aria-label for accessibility
and supports bindable value for two-way data binding, along with standard form
attributes like required and disabled.

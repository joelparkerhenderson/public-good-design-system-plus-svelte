# Gantt chart

A Gantt chart is a UI/UX component that displays project tasks and their
timelines as horizontal bars along a time axis, providing a visual overview of
project schedules, dependencies, and progress. Commonly used in project
management tools, resource planning applications, and team collaboration
platforms, the Gantt chart helps users understand task durations, overlaps,
milestones, and sequencing at a glance. It transforms complex scheduling data
into an intuitive visual format that supports planning and tracking workflows.
Effective Gantt chart design uses a table grid structure for semantic
representation of tasks and time periods, includes accessible labels describing
the chart content, and ensures that screen reader users can navigate the grid
to understand task relationships and scheduling information.

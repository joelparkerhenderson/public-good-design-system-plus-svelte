# Table of contents

A table of contents (TOC) is a UI/UX component that provides a structured,
hierarchical overview of the content on a page or within a document, typically
listing section headings as clickable links. It helps users quickly navigate to
specific parts of the content without scrolling, improving accessibility and
ease of use—especially in long-form pages like articles, documentation, or
reports. A well-designed TOC enhances the user experience by offering clear
orientation, reducing cognitive load, and enabling faster information retrieval.
It’s often presented as a sidebar, dropdown, or sticky element that stays
visible as users scroll through the content.

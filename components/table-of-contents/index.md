# Table of contents

A table of contents (TOC) is a UI/UX component that provides a structured,
hierarchical overview of the content on a page or within a document, typically
listing section headings as clickable links. It helps users quickly navigate to
specific parts of the content without scrolling, improving accessibility and
ease of use -- especially in long-form pages like articles, documentation, or
reports. A well-designed TOC enhances the user experience by offering clear
orientation, reducing cognitive load, and enabling faster information retrieval.
It is often presented as a sidebar, dropdown, or sticky element that stays
visible as users scroll through the content.

This component renders as a semantic <nav> element with an accessible label,
creating a navigation landmark that screen readers can identify and announce.
The consumer provides the content structure (typically a nested list of links)
through the children snippet.

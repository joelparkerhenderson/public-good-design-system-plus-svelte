# Progress bar

A progress bar is a UI/UX component that visually indicates the completion
status of a task or process, such as file uploads, form submissions, or loading
sequences. It uses the native HTML `<progress>` element for semantic meaning and
built-in accessibility support. The component supports both determinate progress
(with a known value and maximum) and indeterminate progress (when the completion
percentage is unknown). An aria-label provides an accessible name for screen
readers, ensuring users of assistive technologies can understand the purpose of
the progress indicator.

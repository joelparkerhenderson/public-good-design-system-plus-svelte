# Warning callout

A warning callout is a UI/UX component used to draw attention to important
alerts or potential issues that require user attention or caution. Typically
styled with bold colors like yellow or orange, and accompanied by an icon (e.g.,
an exclamation mark), it is used to highlight warnings, errors, or critical
information that could affect the user's experience or actions. Warning callouts
are often placed prominently within the interface to ensure they are noticed,
and they may include additional text or links to help users understand the issue
or take corrective actions. A well-designed warning callout ensures clarity
without overwhelming the user, guiding them toward the necessary next steps.

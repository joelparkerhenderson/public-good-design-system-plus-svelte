# QR code

A QR code is a UI/UX component that displays a two-dimensional barcode encoding
data such as URLs, text, contact information, or other machine-readable content.
Commonly used for sharing links, mobile payments, event check-ins, product
information, and authentication workflows, the QR code provides a quick way to
transfer information from a screen to a mobile device camera. The component
serves as a headless container that consumers populate with their preferred
rendering approach, whether SVG paths, canvas drawings, or third-party QR
generation libraries. Effective QR code design uses an image role with a
descriptive accessible label so that screen reader users understand what the
QR code represents and what action scanning it will perform, ensuring the
encoded information is available to all users regardless of their ability to
scan the visual code.

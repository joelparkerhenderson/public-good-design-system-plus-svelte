# Range calendar

A range calendar is a UI/UX component that presents a calendar grid specifically
designed for selecting a range of dates, highlighting the span between a chosen
start date and end date. Commonly used in booking interfaces, vacation planners,
availability selectors, and reporting date filters, the range calendar provides
a visual representation of consecutive days that makes it easy for users to see
and adjust their selected date span. Unlike a standard date picker that selects
a single date, the range calendar emphasizes the continuous interval between two
dates. Effective range calendar design uses an application role to support rich
keyboard interactions, provides an accessible label describing the calendar
purpose, and clearly conveys the selected range and navigation state to
assistive technologies.

# Chart

A chart is a UI/UX component used to visually represent data through graphical
formats such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, area charts, and scatter
plots. Commonly used in dashboards, reports, analytics tools, and data-driven
applications, charts transform raw numbers into visual patterns that make trends,
comparisons, and distributions easier to understand at a glance. A well-designed
chart container provides semantic structure through a figure element, includes an
accessible label describing what the chart represents, and allows consumers to
render their preferred visualization library or SVG content inside it. Effective
chart design ensures that data visualizations are accompanied by meaningful
descriptions so that users relying on assistive technologies can access the
information being conveyed.

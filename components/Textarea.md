# Textarea

A textarea is a UI/UX component that allows users to input and edit multiple
lines of text, commonly used in forms for comments, messages, descriptions, or
feedback. Unlike a standard input field that accepts a single line, a textarea
provides a larger, scrollable text box that supports extended content. It can be
resized by users (depending on the design) and may include placeholder text,
character counters, or validation feedback to guide input. A textarea enhances
user interaction by offering a flexible and comfortable space for expressing
more detailed thoughts or information within a clean and accessible interface.

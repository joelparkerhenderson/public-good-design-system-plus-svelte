# Color picker

A color picker is a UI/UX component that allows users to select a color value
from a visual interface, typically providing a spectrum of colors or a set of
predefined swatches. Commonly used in design tools, theme customizers, form
builders, and creative applications, the color picker enables intuitive color
selection without requiring users to manually enter color codes. It provides
real-time feedback as users interact with it, often displaying the selected
color alongside its hex, RGB, or HSL value. Effective color picker design
wraps the native browser color input for broad compatibility, supports
two-way binding for seamless state management, and includes accessible
labeling so that screen reader users understand the purpose and current
value of the color selection.

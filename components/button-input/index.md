# Button Input

A button input is a form component that wraps the native HTML
`<input type="button">` element. Unlike the `<button>` element which can
contain rich content (icons, formatted text), the button input displays its
label as the `value` attribute and renders only plain text.

This component is useful in form contexts where the native input semantics are
preferred, or when interacting with systems that expect `<input>` elements. The
button input supports the same keyboard interactions as a regular button —
Enter and Space to activate.

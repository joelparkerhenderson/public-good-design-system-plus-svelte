# Hamburger menu

A hamburger menu is a UI/UX component represented by a small icon with three
horizontal lines, resembling a hamburger, typically located in the top corner of
a user interface. When clicked or tapped, it reveals a hidden navigation menu or
list of options, helping to keep the main interface clean and
uncluttered—especially on mobile devices or smaller screens. While it saves
space and simplifies the layout, its discoverability and usability have been
debated, as some users may not immediately recognize its function without prior
experience.

# Radio button

A radio button is a UI/UX component that allows users to select one option from
a predefined set of mutually exclusive choices. Typically represented as small
circular buttons, radio buttons are used in forms or surveys where only one
option is allowed to be selected at a time. When a user clicks on a radio
button, it becomes filled or checked, while other buttons in the same group are
automatically deselected. This behavior visually indicates the user's choice,
making it clear that only one selection is possible. Radio buttons enhance
usability by providing a simple, intuitive way to make single-choice selections
within a group of options.

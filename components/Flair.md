# Flair

A flair is a small UI/UX component used to add visual emphasis, personality, or
categorization to elements within an interface, often in the form of colorful
tags, icons, or labels. Commonly seen in forums, social platforms, or
dashboards, flair can indicate user roles, content types, statuses, or personal
expression (e.g., a badge showing "Moderator" or a tag like "Urgent"). It helps
users quickly identify context or add a touch of individuality to their profiles
or posts. Well-designed flair is subtle yet noticeable, using consistent styling
and color coding to enhance usability without overwhelming the interface.

- Decorative by default (`aria-hidden="true"`)
- Meaningful when `label` provided (`aria-label`)

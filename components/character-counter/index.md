# Character counter

A character counter is a UI/UX component that displays the number of characters
a user has typed into an input field, often alongside or beneath the field
itself. It’s commonly used in text inputs with character limits—such as tweets,
SMS messages, form fields, or bios—to help users stay within constraints.
Character counters can show remaining characters, total characters used, or
both, and often update dynamically as the user types. When well-designed, this
component improves usability by providing clear, real-time feedback, preventing
errors, and reducing user frustration related to input limits.

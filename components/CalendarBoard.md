# Calendar board

A calendar board is a UI/UX component that presents dates in a structured grid
layout, typically organized by weeks and days, allowing users to view and
interact with calendar data at a glance. Commonly used in scheduling
applications, event planners, and dashboard interfaces, the calendar board
renders dates as cells within a table grid, making it easy to scan across days,
weeks, or months. The board provides a spatial overview of time-based
information, enabling users to quickly identify dates, spot patterns, and
navigate temporal data. Effective calendar board design ensures clear grid
structure, proper heading labels for days and months, and accessible navigation
for keyboard and screen reader users.

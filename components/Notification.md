# Notification

A notification is a UI/UX component used to deliver timely, non-intrusive
messages to users about events, updates, or actions within an application.
Unlike alerts, notifications are usually passive and do not interrupt the user’s
workflow—they often appear as banners, toasts, or badges in a corner of the
interface or notification center. Notifications can inform users about new
messages, background processes, or system statuses and may disappear
automatically or allow manual dismissal. Effective notification design balances
visibility and subtlety, ensuring users stay informed without feeling
overwhelmed or distracted.

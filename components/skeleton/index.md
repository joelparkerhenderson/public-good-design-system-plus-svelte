# Skeleton

A skeleton is a UI/UX component that serves as a loading placeholder, indicating
that content is in the process of loading. It uses aria-hidden="true" to hide the
placeholder from screen readers and aria-busy="true" to signal that the region is
being updated. Skeleton components are commonly used to show the approximate
layout of content before it loads, reducing perceived loading time and preventing
layout shift. The component is headless, allowing consumers to style the
placeholder shapes with their own CSS.

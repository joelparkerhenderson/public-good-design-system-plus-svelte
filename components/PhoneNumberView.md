# PhoneNumberView

A phone number view displays a phone number as a clickable `tel:` link, allowing users on mobile devices to initiate a phone call directly by tapping or clicking the number. This is part of the Input/View pattern where PhoneNumberView is the read-only display counterpart.

The component is useful for contact pages, business listings, user profiles, customer support sections, and any context where a phone number should be displayed as an actionable link rather than plain text.

## Implementation Notes

- Renders an `<a>` element with an `href="tel:{phone}"` attribute for native phone dialing.
- The phone number text is displayed as the link content.
- An optional `label` prop provides an accessible name via `aria-label` when the phone number alone is not descriptive enough (e.g., "Call customer support at +1-555-0100").
- Spreads `restProps` onto the `<a>` element for consumer customization.
- No internal state management; this is a purely presentational component.

## Props

- `phone`: string (required) -- the phone number to display and link to (should include country code, e.g., `"+1-555-0100"`).
- `label`: string (default: `undefined`) -- optional accessible name applied via `aria-label` for additional context.
- `...restProps`: unknown -- additional attributes spread onto the `<a>` element.

## Usage

```svelte
<PhoneNumberView phone="+1-555-0100" />
```

```svelte
<PhoneNumberView phone="+1-555-0100" label="Call customer support" />
```

## Keyboard Interactions

None -- this component uses a native `<a>` element, which provides built-in keyboard support (Tab to focus, Enter to activate the link).

## ARIA

- `aria-label` -- when provided, gives an accessible name that provides more context than the phone number alone (e.g., describing who the number belongs to or its purpose).

# Tab

A tab is a UI/UX component that allows users to navigate between different
sections of content within a single interface by clicking or tapping on labeled
tabs, typically displayed horizontally at the top of a content area. Each tab
represents a distinct section, and only the content related to the active tab is
displayed at a time, keeping the interface clean and organized. Tabs help group
similar information in a compact and accessible way, allowing users to switch
between views without reloading or navigating away from the page. They enhance
usability by providing an intuitive, quick way to explore different content or
options within the same context.

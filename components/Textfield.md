# Textfield

A textfield is a UI/UX component that provides a single-line text input field.
It is functionally equivalent to a text input and serves as an alternative naming
convention commonly used in material design and other design systems. The
component uses the native HTML `<input type="text">` element with aria-label for
accessibility, and supports bindable value for two-way data binding along with
standard form attributes.

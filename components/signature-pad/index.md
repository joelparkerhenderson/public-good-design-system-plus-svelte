# Signature pad

A signature pad is a UI/UX component that provides a drawing surface for users
to capture handwritten signatures, typically using mouse, touch, or stylus
input. Commonly used in contract signing workflows, consent forms, delivery
confirmations, and legal document processing, the signature pad brings the
familiar pen-on-paper signing experience to digital interfaces. The component
serves as a headless container that consumers populate with their preferred
drawing implementation, whether HTML canvas, SVG paths, or a third-party
signature library. Effective signature pad design uses an application role to
support complex pointer interactions, includes an accessible label describing
the signing purpose, and provides alternative input methods or clear
instructions so that users who cannot draw with a pointer can still complete
the signature requirement.

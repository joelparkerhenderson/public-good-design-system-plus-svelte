# Do/don't list

A do/don't list is a UI/UX component designed to guide users by clearly
outlining actions that should or should not be taken in a given context. It
typically presents two distinct columns or sections, one for recommended
behaviors (do's) and another for discouraged or incorrect behaviors (don'ts).
This component is often used in instructional, onboarding, or error prevention
contexts to help users quickly understand best practices, avoid mistakes, or
follow guidelines effectively. Well-designed do/don't lists use concise
language, clear visuals or icons, and easy-to-read layouts, ensuring that users
can easily grasp the key points without confusion or overwhelm.

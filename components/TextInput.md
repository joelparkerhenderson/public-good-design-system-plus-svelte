# Text input

A text input is a UI/UX component that provides a single-line text field for
entering short text values such as names, titles, or other brief textual data. It
uses the native HTML `<input type="text">` element with aria-label for
accessibility. The component supports bindable value for two-way data binding and
standard form attributes like required and disabled.

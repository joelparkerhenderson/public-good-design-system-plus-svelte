# Expander

An expander shows or hides additional content with a toggle control.
Similar to details/collapsible but uses a button trigger with
aria-expanded for custom implementations.
# Expander

- Button with `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls`
- `$bindable()` expanded prop
- Content in `role="region"` when expanded

# Emoji

An emoji is a UI/UX component used to express emotions, reactions, or concepts
through small, universally recognizable pictorial symbols. Emojis are often
integrated into messaging systems, social media platforms, and interactive
interfaces, allowing users to quickly communicate tone, mood, or context in a
fun and visually engaging way. They can be selected from an emoji picker or
keyboard and are commonly used to enhance user interactions, add personality,
and increase engagement in digital communication. Well-designed emoji
integration ensures accessibility, offers a diverse range of options for
expression, and maintains clarity across different devices and platforms.

# Time picker

A time picker is a UI/UX component that allows users to select a specific time
of day, often used alongside a date picker in forms, scheduling tools, or
booking systems. It typically presents a dropdown or interactive interface with
options for hours, minutes, and sometimes AM/PM or seconds, enabling precise and
error-free time input without manual typing. Time pickers enhance usability by
offering a clear and structured way to enter time values, reducing input
mistakes and improving the overall user experience. A well-designed time picker
is intuitive, accessible, and adaptable to various formats (12-hour or 24-hour),
making it easy for users to set appointments, reminders, or deadlines.

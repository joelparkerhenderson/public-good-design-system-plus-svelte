# Label

A label is a UI/UX component that provides a descriptive name or instruction for
an associated form element, such as an input field, checkbox, or radio button.
It enhances accessibility and usability by clearly indicating the purpose of the
form element, making it easier for users to understand what information is being
requested. Labels are typically placed next to or above the corresponding form
controls, and when correctly linked with the form element (using the `for`
attribute in HTML), they improve interaction, especially for screen reader
users. Well-designed labels contribute to a more intuitive and inclusive user
experience, ensuring that users can navigate and fill out forms with ease.

# Footnote

A footnote is a UI/UX component used to provide additional information,
citations, or clarifications without cluttering the main content. Typically
displayed at the bottom of a page, section, or element, footnotes offer context,
references, or explanations that support the primary content. In digital
interfaces, footnotes are often linked or numbered, allowing users to easily
navigate between the main text and supplementary details. Effective footnote
design ensures that the extra information is easily accessible yet unobtrusive,
helping to maintain the flow of content while providing valuable insights or
references when needed.

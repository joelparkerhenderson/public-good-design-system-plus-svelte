# Table

A table is a UI/UX component used to display structured data in rows and
columns, making it easy to compare and analyze information at a glance. Commonly
used for things like reports, schedules, product lists, or dashboards, tables
organize content into headers and cells, often with features like sorting,
filtering, pagination, and inline editing to enhance usability. A well-designed
table improves data readability, supports efficient decision-making, and allows
users to quickly find patterns or specific details. Tables are essential in
data-heavy interfaces, offering both clarity and functionality in a compact
format.

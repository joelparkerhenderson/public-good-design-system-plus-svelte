# Call to action (CTA)

A call to action (CTA) is a UI/UX component designed to prompt users to take a
specific action, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or making a
purchase. CTAs are typically clear, concise, and visually distinct, often using
contrasting colors, bold text, or icons to stand out and guide users towards the
next step. They play a crucial role in driving user engagement and conversions
by directing attention to key actions within an interface, such as "Sign Up,"
"Learn More," or "Buy Now." A well-designed CTA balances visibility with
clarity, ensuring users understand the action they need to take and are
motivated to act.

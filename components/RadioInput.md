# Radio input

A radio input is a UI/UX component that provides a bare radio button input
element without a wrapping label. It uses aria-label for accessibility, making it
suitable for use in custom radio group layouts where labels are provided
separately or by parent components. The input supports standard radio attributes
including name for grouping, value for the option value, and checked state for
selection tracking.

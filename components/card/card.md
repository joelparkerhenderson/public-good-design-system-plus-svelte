# Card

A card is a UI/UX component that presents content and actions related to a
single subject in a visually distinct, contained layout—often resembling a
physical card. It typically includes elements like images, titles, text,
buttons, or icons, and is used to group information in a clean, digestible
format. Cards are commonly seen in dashboards, product listings, news feeds, and
profile summaries, providing a modular and responsive way to organize and
display content. Their flexible design enhances visual hierarchy and
scannability, making it easier for users to browse, interact with, and
understand information at a glance.

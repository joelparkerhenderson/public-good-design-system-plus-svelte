# Calendar range picker

A calendar range picker is a UI/UX component that allows users to select a
contiguous range of dates by interacting with a visual calendar grid. Commonly
used in booking systems, travel planners, analytics dashboards, and reporting
tools, the calendar range picker lets users define a start date and an end date
by clicking or tapping on calendar cells. It provides an intuitive way to
specify date spans without manual text entry, reducing input errors and
improving efficiency. Effective calendar range picker design highlights the
selected range visually, supports keyboard navigation for accessible date
selection, and clearly communicates the current selection state to assistive
technologies.

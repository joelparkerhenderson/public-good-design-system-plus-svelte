# Review Date

A review date is a UI/UX component that displays a date associated with a
review, audit, or scheduled check-in. It renders as a semantic HTML `<time>`
element with a machine-readable `datetime` attribute in ISO 8601 format and
human-readable display text provided through a children snippet. This
separation allows browsers and assistive technologies to parse the date for
accurate interpretation while displaying a user-friendly formatted date. The
component is commonly used in dashboards, compliance tracking, audit logs, and
scheduling interfaces where dates need to be both human-readable and
machine-parseable.

# Fieldset

A fieldset is a UI/UX component used to group related form elements together,
often visually enclosed with a border, to indicate they belong to the same
category or set of information. Typically used in forms, fieldsets help organize
input fields logically, making the form more structured and easier to
understand. A legend element can be included within the fieldset to provide a
title or description for the group, further enhancing clarity. By visually
grouping related inputs, fieldsets improve form usability, guiding users through
complex forms and improving accessibility for screen readers.

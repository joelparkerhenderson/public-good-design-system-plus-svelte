# Date picker

A date picker is a UI/UX component that allows users to easily select a specific
date (and sometimes time) from a visual calendar interface, rather than typing
it manually. Often used in forms, booking systems, and scheduling tools, it
typically appears as a pop-up calendar when a user clicks on a date input field.
Date pickers enhance usability by minimizing input errors, speeding up data
entry, and providing a clear, intuitive way to navigate through days, months,
and years. A well-designed date picker improves user efficiency and accuracy,
especially when dealing with date-sensitive tasks like reservations, deadlines,
or event planning.

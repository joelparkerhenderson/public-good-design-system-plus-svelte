# Submit input

A submit input is a UI/UX component that provides a form submission button using
the native HTML `<input type="submit">` element. When clicked within a form, it
triggers the form's submit event. The component supports custom button text
through the value prop and can be disabled to prevent premature submission. It
provides a simple, semantic way to add form submission capability that works with
the browser's built-in form handling.

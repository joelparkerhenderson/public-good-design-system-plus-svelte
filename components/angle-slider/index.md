# Angle Slider

An angle slider is a specialized range input component for selecting an angle
value, typically between 0 and 360 degrees. Built on the native HTML range input,
it provides semantic ARIA slider attributes including value text that conveys
the angle with a degree symbol to screen readers.

Common uses include rotation controls, compass direction selectors, gradient
angle pickers, and any interface where a circular or angular value needs to be
selected by the user. The step property allows snapping to common increments
like 15° or 45°.

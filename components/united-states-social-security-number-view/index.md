# United States Social Security Number View

A United States Social Security Number (SSN) view is a display component for
showing a 9-digit SSN in a read-only format. The SSN is issued by the Social
Security Administration and serves as a national identifier for taxation, credit
reporting, and various government and private-sector purposes.

This component renders the SSN as an inline span element with an accessible
label, making it suitable for use in personal records, confirmation screens,
account summaries, or any context where an SSN needs to be displayed but not
edited. The accessible label ensures screen readers can announce the purpose of
the displayed number.

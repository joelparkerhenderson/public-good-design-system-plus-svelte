# Details

A details UI/UX component is used to reveal or hide additional information on
demand, allowing interfaces to remain clean and uncluttered while still offering
in-depth content when needed. Commonly implemented as collapsible sections or
expandable panels, the details component lets users control the visibility of
secondary content such as explanations, specifications, FAQs, or advanced
options. It enhances usability by supporting progressive disclosure—showing only
what’s necessary upfront and letting users access more as desired. Effective
details components are clearly labeled, easy to toggle, and designed to maintain
context, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

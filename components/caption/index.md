# Caption

A caption is a UI/UX component used to provide supplementary text or
explanations alongside images, videos, charts, or other media within an
interface. It typically appears below or near the media element, offering
context, descriptions, or additional details to enhance user understanding.
Captions are often used in galleries, product pages, or educational content to
clarify or add value to visual elements. Effective caption design ensures
readability through appropriate font size, contrast, and concise wording,
helping users interpret the media more easily without overwhelming the main
content.

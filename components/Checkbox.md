# Checkbox

A checkbox is a UI/UX component that allows users to select one or more options
from a list by toggling individual boxes on or off. Represented as small square
boxes that display a checkmark when selected, checkboxes are commonly used in
forms, settings, filters, and preference menus where multiple selections are
allowed. They offer a simple and intuitive way for users to make binary choices
(checked or unchecked), and are often accompanied by labels to clearly describe
the option. Checkboxes enhance usability by supporting flexibility in user input
and ensuring that selections are easy to understand, modify, and submit.

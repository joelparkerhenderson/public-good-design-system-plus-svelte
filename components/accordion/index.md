# Accordion

An accordion is a UI/UX component used to organize and display content in a
space-efficient, collapsible format. It consists of vertically stacked sections,
each with a clickable header that expands or collapses its associated content.
This design helps reduce visual clutter, allowing users to focus on one section
at a time while keeping other content hidden until needed. Commonly used in
FAQs, filters, or mobile menus, accordions enhance usability by streamlining
content access and improving navigation on both desktop and mobile interfaces.

# Emoji character picker

An emoji character picker is a UI/UX component that presents a grid of emoji
characters for users to browse and select from. Commonly used in messaging
applications, social media platforms, comment systems, and rich text editors,
the emoji character picker provides an organized, searchable interface for
inserting emoji into text. The grid layout allows users to scan through
available emoji quickly, often organized by category such as smileys, animals,
food, and symbols. Effective emoji character picker design uses an accessible
grid role for structured navigation, supports keyboard traversal between emoji
cells, and provides clear labeling so that screen reader users can identify
each emoji and understand the purpose of the picker.

# Tooltip

A tooltip is a UI/UX component that provides brief, contextual information when
a user hovers over, focuses on, or taps an element—typically icons, buttons, or
form fields. Tooltips are used to clarify the function or meaning of an element
without cluttering the interface, offering helpful hints, labels, or
explanations on demand. They usually appear as small floating boxes near the
target element and disappear when the interaction ends. Tooltips enhance
usability by guiding users subtly and efficiently, especially in interfaces
where space is limited or where actions may not be immediately self-explanatory.

# Hint

A hint is a UI/UX component that provides subtle, contextual guidance or
suggestions to help users understand how to interact with an element or complete
a task. Often displayed as placeholder text, tooltips, or inline messages near
input fields or buttons, hints aim to reduce confusion and improve usability
without interrupting the user flow. They can clarify expected formats, explain
functionality, or offer examples, especially in forms or complex interfaces. A
well-crafted hint is concise, timely, and easy to dismiss or ignore once
understood, ensuring it supports the user experience without becoming a
distraction.

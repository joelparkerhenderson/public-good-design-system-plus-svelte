# Popover

A popover is a UI/UX component that displays contextual information or actions
in a small overlay that appears near the element that triggered it, such as a
button, icon, or link. Unlike tooltips, popovers can contain richer content—like
text, images, buttons, or form fields—and often require user interaction to
dismiss. They are commonly used to provide quick access to related tools or
details without navigating away from the current page. Effective popover design
ensures it is clearly connected to its trigger, positioned intuitively, and easy
to close, enhancing the user experience by offering relevant information or
actions without disrupting workflow.

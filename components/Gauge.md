# Gauge

A gauge is a UI/UX component used to visually represent a value within a defined
range, often resembling a dial or meter. It’s commonly used in dashboards or
monitoring tools to display metrics like speed, progress, temperature, or system
performance at a glance. Gauges provide an intuitive way to understand data
trends and thresholds, often incorporating color coding (e.g., green for safe,
red for critical) and markers to indicate ideal or warning levels. When designed
well, a gauge offers immediate visual feedback, helping users quickly assess
status without needing to interpret raw data.

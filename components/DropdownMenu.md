# Dropdown menu

A dropdown menu is a UI/UX component that allows users to select an option from
a list that appears when they click or hover over a designated menu button or
area. Typically used to save space, dropdown menus are ideal for displaying
multiple choices or actions within a compact interface. They can contain a
variety of items, such as navigation links, settings, or actions, and often
feature hierarchical submenus for additional options. A well-designed dropdown
menu offers smooth interaction, clear labeling, and easy navigation, ensuring
users can quickly find and select the desired option without confusion or
frustration.

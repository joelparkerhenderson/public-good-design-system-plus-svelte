# Dialog

A dialog is a UI/UX component used to communicate information to users or prompt
them to take an action within an application. Typically appearing as a small
window overlaying the main interface, dialogs can be modal (requiring user
interaction before proceeding) or non-modal (allowing interaction with the
background). They serve purposes like confirmations, alerts, input requests, or
settings adjustments. Good dialog design ensures clarity, minimal disruption,
and clear call-to-action buttons (e.g., "OK", "Cancel") to guide users smoothly
through tasks or decisions.

# Footer

A footer is a UI/UX component located at the bottom of a web page or app screen,
typically used to provide secondary navigation, legal information, contact
details, and links to important but less prominent content like privacy
policies, terms of service, or social media profiles. It serves as a closing
section that helps users find additional resources or revisit key areas without
scrolling back to the top. A well-structured footer improves site usability,
reinforces trust, and ensures accessibility to critical information, especially
on long or content-rich pages.

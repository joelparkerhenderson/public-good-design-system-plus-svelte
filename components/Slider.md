# Slider

A slider is a UI/UX component that allows users to select a value or range of
values by dragging a handle along a track, typically used for adjusting settings
like volume, brightness, price ranges, or timelines. It provides an intuitive
and interactive way to input data within a defined minimum and maximum, often
displaying real-time feedback as the user moves the slider. Sliders can be
horizontal or vertical and may include labels, tick marks, or numeric indicators
for clarity. Effective slider design ensures smooth handling, visual
responsiveness, and accessibility, enabling precise adjustments while keeping
the interface clean and user-friendly.

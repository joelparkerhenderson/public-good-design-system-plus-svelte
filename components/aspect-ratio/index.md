# Aspect Ratio

An aspect ratio component is a layout utility that constrains its content to a
specific width-to-height ratio. It ensures that images, videos, maps, and other
embedded content maintain consistent proportions regardless of the container
size. Common aspect ratios include 16:9 (widescreen video), 4:3 (traditional
display), 1:1 (square, often for avatars or thumbnails), and 21:9 (ultrawide).

This component sets the CSS `aspect-ratio` property on a wrapper element,
allowing consumers to control sizing through their own stylesheets while the
component guarantees the proportional constraint.

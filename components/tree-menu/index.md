# Tree menu

A tree menu is a UI/UX component that displays hierarchical or nested navigation
options, often represented with expandable and collapsible nodes, resembling the
structure of a tree. Each node in the tree menu can contain sub-options or
categories, allowing users to drill down into deeper levels of content or
functionality. This type of menu is particularly useful for organizing complex
or large datasets, file directories, or multi-level categories, as it visually
reflects relationships between different elements. Tree menus enhance usability
by providing an intuitive, organized way to navigate through structured data
while maintaining a compact layout.

# Week input

A week input is a UI/UX component that provides a field for selecting a specific
week of the year using the native HTML `<input type="week">` element. It renders
a week picker control that allows users to select a year and week number, with
values in YYYY-Www format (e.g., "2024-W01"). The component includes aria-label
for accessibility and supports bindable value for two-way data binding, along
with standard form attributes like required and disabled.

# Progress spinner

A progress spinner is a UI/UX component that indicates an ongoing loading or
processing state. It uses role="status" and aria-live="polite" to announce the
loading state to screen readers without interrupting the user. Unlike a progress
bar or circle that show a specific percentage, a progress spinner typically
indicates indeterminate loading where the completion time is unknown. The
component is headless, allowing consumers to apply their own spinning animation
styles via CSS.

# Select

A select is a UI/UX component that provides a dropdown menu, allowing users to
choose one or more options from a list. Typically displayed as a button or input
field that expands when clicked, a select component helps condense a long list
of options into a compact, space-efficient format. It is commonly used in forms,
filters, or settings to offer a wide range of choices, such as selecting a
country, date, or category. The select component enhances usability by keeping
the interface clean and organized, enabling users to quickly navigate through a
set of options and make their selection with ease.

# United States Social Security Number Input

A United States Social Security Number (SSN) input is a specialized form field
for entering a 9-digit SSN issued by the Social Security Administration. The SSN
is used as a national identifier for taxation, credit reporting, and various
government and private-sector purposes.

The standard display format is "XXX-XX-XXXX" (three groups of digits separated
by hyphens: a 3-digit area number, a 2-digit group number, and a 4-digit serial
number). This input component enforces that pattern, uses a numeric keyboard
hint for mobile devices, and disables autocomplete to protect sensitive
personally identifiable information. The component supports required and disabled
states, and provides accessible labeling for screen readers.

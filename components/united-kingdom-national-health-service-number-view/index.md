# United Kingdom National Health Service Number View

A United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) number view is a display
component for showing a 10-digit NHS patient identifier in a read-only format.
The NHS number uniquely identifies individuals registered with the National
Health Service in England, Wales, and the Isle of Man.

This component renders the NHS number as an inline span element with an
accessible label, making it suitable for use in patient records, summaries,
confirmation screens, or any context where an NHS number needs to be displayed
but not edited. The accessible label ensures screen readers can announce the
purpose of the displayed number.

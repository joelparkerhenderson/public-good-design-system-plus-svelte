# Avatar circle

An avatar circle is a UI/UX component that displays a user’s profile image or
initials within a circular frame, commonly used to represent a user identity in
apps, websites, and social platforms. This visual element provides a quick,
recognizable way for users to identify themselves or others, often appearing in
headers, comments, chat interfaces, and account menus. The circular shape is
aesthetically pleasing and universally recognized as a placeholder for personal
identity, contributing to a more humanized and personalized user experience.
When no image is available, initials or default icons are often shown inside the
circle.

# Public Good Design System Svelte Components

1. Create file `plan.md` and file `tasks.md` before starting any implementation work; include technical implementation details and anything helpful; do not include timelines.
2. Create the file `plan.md` that has the complete plan; document everything, with all the key findings, context and information that might help with the implementation, which will be used as a reference while implementing.
3. Create the file `tasks.md` that will track the tasks during the implementation, and that will reference the file `plan.md`.
4. Create the tasks in the alphabetic order of the component name.
